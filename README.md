## Battery

- AirBuddy
  Unlike iPhone and iPad, Apple doesn't show the battery status of AirPods when opened next to a Mac. AirBuddy elegantly solves this by showing a near-native designed popup indicating the current battery status of my AirPods Pro. Not just that, it also shows the power left in other bluetooth prepherils near me.

- AlDente
  My Mac is always plugged-in and being powered by a monitor, and that's where AlDente comes in! It's a great utility that I've configured not to overcharge my MacBook Pro. It's always set to 70% maximum. AlDente also comes with some other great features like status indicator in the menubar, battery calibration (which I have set as a weekly trigger), and heat-sensitive battery charging among others.

## Window Management

- AltTab
  I have used Windows as my main operaring system back in the day and perhaps the only thing I missed from that era was the tab view of every window when using Ctrl+Tab to cycle through them. Mac just doesn't do that alright, it shows an icon of the app, regardless whether any window of that app is opened at all or 10 windows are opened at once. AltTab single-handedly solves this problem for me. Plus, it's got a lot more options to configure, e.g. whether to tab through windows across different desktops which I've used in the past.
- Magnet
  Another jewel in Windows, quickly snapping Windows to the side, on the top, equally divide all the space among 4 apps, you name it! Magnet does it all very well. I rely on the keyboard shortcuts 99% of the time but we can snap window to the top, bottom, etc. and it's got excellent support for gestures. We can also achieve some of these configurations from the menubar option as well.
- Dropover
  Dropover is a simple utility that I mainly use for two things. To create shelves of files, e.g. when taking a screenshot, one can hold the just screenshoted-thumbnail and put it into a shelve. This way, we can drop the image from the shelve to the app where we want that photo tyo be. Multiple shelves can be created to temporarily hold various kind of files for categoriozation purpose, etc. My second use with this is to quickly share a file with anyone using a URL. Dropover can do this using iCloud, Dropbox etc, or through its own service which is something I usually do to share some non-important files across.
- Velja
  Sindre built this amazing utility which can be set as your default browser (though it's not a browser itself!) and we can define various rules based on domain matching, RegEx, subdomain, URL containing a particular string, etc. and route different URLs to different browsers.
  I have plenty of these custom rules, but one scenario where this helps me a lot is to open all the `localhost` URLs in `Arc` which is my preffered browser for development work and not in Safari (I hate their DevTools!) which I use for everything else.

## Cleanup

- AppCleaner
  Mac apps often create a lot of other directories, caches, etc. When uninstalled by simply dragging to Trash, sometimes those caches, files, etc. are not deleted. This is where I use `AppCleaner`! I just drag the app onto it and it automatically find all the files relevant to that app and I can delete all of that stuff together at once.
- DaisyDisk
  Just like any software OS, Junk can pile up over time in Mac as well. Caches, unused apps, system junk, projects you don't need anymore, etc. `DaisyDisk` helps there a lot. I run this every once in a while, and it categorizes everything for me, and I can delete everything that's needed anymore.

## Browser

- Arc
  I love `Arc`! The sidebar with tabs, spaces to manage different aspects of work, (for example one space per client, etc.) and so many other great posibilities. Because I develop software for the web, `Chromium` based browser is something where I need to test stuff first. Arc has been excellent for me so far and I use it primarily for software development, and to achieve work-related separation with the use of spaces.
- Safari
  Though I love `Arc`, Safari is my main browser and have been for a really long-time because it can sync tabs for me across my iPhone, and iPad. A tad more secure and less power-intensive (I'm looking at you, Chrome!) and just sits nice with the overall Apple's ecosystem. I've been eyeing on `Arc`'s mobile app and who knows I'll switch full-time once their mobile app matures.

## Mac Menubar

- Bartender 5
  This is one-heck of a utility! I've fully customized my Mac's menubar to look different on an external monitor vs my MacBook's 14 inch screen which can only house so much. Another thing I love about Bartender is how we can remove space among menubar icons to fit more in less space. I've also customized it a lot using background gradient, borders, and whatnot and I think my menubar was worthless before I started using Bartender!

## Developer Tools

- Boop
- Cakebrew
- Fig
- Figma
- Fork
- GitHub
- GitHub Desktop
- Visual Studio Code
- RapidAPI

## Scheduling & Planning

- Apple Calendar
  I have various calendars I need to manage and be on top of and I think Apple's built-in Calendar app just does that for me, or I should say, does that really well. I can define colour tags for different calendars and the first-class integration with Apple's softwares on iPhone, and iPad makes this an amazing app for me. I know people tend to use other calendar management apps, `Cron` is one of the new ones and getting lots of traction but `Calendar` does everything I want so I'm sticking with it. Don't touch it if it's working!
- Reminders
  Task management is a different situation from calendar where I've tried various other apps before coming back to Apple's built-in `Reminders`. I couldn't imagine this just two years ago in 2021, when I bought `Things 3` and moved away from `Todoist`. `Reminders` has matured a lot since then, it's got projects (or list as they call it), a whole lot of customization and to organize various lists in folders, first-class Siri support, etc. I moved to Reminders full-time from Things in October 2023, and I think I'm sticking with it!

## Note Taking

- Apple Notes
  Just like Reminders, my typed-notes have been roaming around for a while. I started with `Evernote`, then moved to `OneNote` from Microsoft, `Notion` came along and I jumped on that train and used it for years when I got frustrated with its clunkiness as my notes grew in size as well as number. I briefly moved to `Obsidian` but it seemed extremely ugly to me (I prefer form over function!). This continued, and I experimented with various other apps, while briefly stoppin at `Craft` and in the meanwhile, Apple's very-own `Notes` app got very matured and I started uing their `Quick Note` feature which eventually sucked me into using `Notes` full-time and I think there isn't anything that I'm missing from any of the apps I've previously used, Apple Notes FTW!
- Feyn
  It's a great little app to build flash-cards and I've used it couple times to study. It's very well-built and makes me feel in the Apple's ecosystem.
- Freeform
  I used Apple's Notes for ideation and mind-mapping on iPad using Apple Pencil and now I does that using `Freeform`, it doesn't have all the bells and whistels but it's a solid app that I use from time-to-time to try and refine new ideas and other early prototypes.
- Goodnotes
  Goodnotes has been my primary hand-writte notes app eversince I bought an iPad back in 2021. Whenever I'm taking a new course or learning something new on my own, I jot-down stuff in it and have never felt a need to move away to anything else.

## Cacluation

- Numi
  Numi adds a wealth of opportunities and basically combines a notepad and a calculator into one handly little utility which I always keep open to convert stuff

## Travel

- Apple Maps
  Apple Maps is my primary choice for routing and navigation purposes now that it's gotten so much better here in Canada, and it works for me really well (again, form over function!)
  Though, I still have to check reviews, business hours, etc. from Google Maps which can easily be done on its website.
- AllTrails
  I love hiking and exploring remote areas and AllTrails works incredibly well to discover and review new hikes when I'm somewhere remote and its offline support is excellent.

## App Updates

- MacUpdater
  This is a handy-little utility which checks all the apps for updates and then pending updates can be installed from the `MacUpdater` app itself which keeps me sane as I like to be on top of everything new.

## AI

- MacGPT
- MacBing
  I don't use it very often, it's there just when ChatGPT doesn't work and `MacBing` basically wraps a container around the Bing AI `WebView`. I have a shortcut set which brings it in view from menubar (how cool is that?) and I can
  ask it anything without switching apps.
- ChatGPT Official App

## Mouse, Keyboard and other desk peripherals

- Logitech G HUB
  To configure and control LogiTech Litra Glow, my preffered lighting solution for video calls.
- Logi Options+
  To configure various keys on my LogiTech MX Master 3, my preferred mouse for all-day work.
- Keyboard Cleaner
  Enabling it avoids unnecessary clicks when I'm cleaning the keyboard on my MacBook.
- Hyperkey
  It's a great little utility which enables a bunch of new keybinding opportunities by utilizing the otherwise left-out `Caps Lock` key, and you can bind shortcuts like `Caps Lock + S` or `Caps Lock + Alt + S`.
  This opens up so many new global keybindings!
- LIFX
  I use `LIFX Z Strip` for backlighting on my monitor and their mobile app to build custom routine, automatically toggle the light based on whether the monitor is turned on or off, etc.

## Screen Management

- Lunar
  It does couple of things for me:
- My MacBook's can get HDR display brightness for SDR content and it helps a lot when I'm working outside where I need MacBook to get really, really bright sometimes.
- Allows me to control the brightness and volume of a connected monitor
- Get sub-zero dimming support which can lower the brightness a whole lot than traditional control

## Password Management

- iCloud Keychain
  It's my primary password manager and being used acorss my Apple devices. Because I dont' have Android, Windows, or any other non-Apple, `iCloud's Keychain` just works for me. Otherwise, `1Password` is something I've tried in the past and it's an excellent choice too.
- LastPass
  `LastPass` stores some very sensitive information for me, where `iCloud Keychain` falls short. I have security questions, product activation keys, licenses, etc. there and I think it serves the purpose extremely well.

## Languages

- Translate
  I use Apple's built-in `Translate` app whenever I'm in a foreign land and need to translate verbally or otherwise parking signs, restuarnats menus, etc.
