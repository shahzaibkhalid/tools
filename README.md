All the amazing tools & tech I have been using ðŸš€

## Adblocker & Privacy

### Adguard

Adguard has been my go-to choice to block ads, fingerprinting and all sorts of nonsense on the web. I have got a family subscription and couldn't recommend it more!

### Hush

It's a Safari extension to block nags to accept cookies and to fight against fingerprinting. I particularly have it there to block the cookies pop-up.

### DuckDuckGo Privacy for Safari

It's also a Safari extension and helps showing ratings of websites, what tracker websites tried to contact and a whole lot of other detail.

## Battery

### AirBuddy

Unlike iPhone and iPad, Apple doesn't show the battery status of AirPods when opened next to a Mac. AirBuddy elegantly solves this by showing a near-native designed popup indicating the current battery status of my AirPods Pro. Not just that, it also shows the power left in other bluetooth prepherils near me.

### AlDente

My Mac is always plugged-in and being powered by a monitor, and that's where AlDente comes in! It's a great utility that I've configured not to overcharge my MacBook Pro. It's always set to 70% maximum. AlDente also comes with some other great features like status indicator in the menubar, battery calibration (which I have set as a weekly trigger), and heat-sensitive battery charging among others.

## Window Management

### AltTab

I have used Windows as my main operaring system back in the day and perhaps the only thing I missed from that era was the tab view of every window when using Ctrl+Tab to cycle through them. Mac just doesn't do that alright, it shows an icon of the app, regardless whether any window of that app is opened at all or 10 windows are opened at once. AltTab single-handedly solves this problem for me. Plus, it's got a lot more options to configure, e.g. whether to tab through windows across different desktops which I've used in the past.

### Magnet

Another jewel in Windows, quickly snapping Windows to the side, on the top, equally divide all the space among 4 apps, you name it! Magnet does it all very well. I rely on the keyboard shortcuts 99% of the time but we can snap window to the top, bottom, etc. and it's got excellent support for gestures. We can also achieve some of these configurations from the menubar option as well.

### Dropover

Dropover is a simple utility that I mainly use for two things. To create shelves of files, e.g. when taking a screenshot, one can hold the just screenshoted-thumbnail and put it into a shelve. This way, we can drop the image from the shelve to the app where we want that photo tyo be. Multiple shelves can be created to temporarily hold various kind of files for categoriozation purpose, etc. My second use with this is to quickly share a file with anyone using a URL. Dropover can do this using iCloud, Dropbox etc, or through its own service which is something I usually do to share some non-important files across.

### Velja

Sindre built this amazing utility which can be set as your default browser (though it's not a browser itself!) and we can define various rules based on domain matching, RegEx, subdomain, URL containing a particular string, etc. and route different URLs to different browsers.
I have plenty of these custom rules, but one scenario where this helps me a lot is to open all the `localhost` URLs in `Arc` which is my preffered browser for development work and not in Safari (I hate their DevTools!) which I use for everything else.

## Cleanup

### AppCleaner

Mac apps often create a lot of other directories, caches, etc. When uninstalled by simply dragging to Trash, sometimes those caches, files, etc. are not deleted. This is where I use `AppCleaner`! I just drag the app onto it and it automatically find all the files relevant to that app and I can delete all of that stuff together at once.

### DaisyDisk

Just like any software OS, Junk can pile up over time in Mac as well. Caches, unused apps, system junk, projects you don't need anymore, etc. `DaisyDisk` helps there a lot. I run this every once in a while, and it categorizes everything for me, and I can delete everything that's needed anymore.

## Browser

### Arc

I love `Arc`! The sidebar with tabs, spaces to manage different aspects of work, (for example one space per client, etc.) and so many other great posibilities. Because I develop software for the web, `Chromium` based browser is something where I need to test stuff first. Arc has been excellent for me so far and I use it primarily for software development, and to achieve work-related separation with the use of spaces.

### Safari

Though I love `Arc`, Safari is my main browser and have been for a really long-time because it can sync tabs for me across my iPhone, and iPad. A tad more secure and less power-intensive (I'm looking at you, Chrome!) and just sits nice with the overall Apple's ecosystem. I've been eyeing on `Arc`'s mobile app and who knows I'll switch full-time once their mobile app matures.

## Mac Menubar

- Bartender 5
  This is one-heck of a utility! I've fully customized my Mac's menubar to look different on an external monitor vs my MacBook's 14 inch screen which can only house so much. Another thing I love about Bartender is how we can remove space among menubar icons to fit more in less space. I've also customized it a lot using background gradient, borders, and whatnot and I think my menubar was worthless before I started using Bartender!

## Developer Tools

- Cakebrew
- Fig
- Figma
- Fork
- GitHub
- GitHub Desktop
- Visual Studio Code

## Scheduling & Planning

- Apple Calendar
  I have various calendars I need to manage and be on top of and I think Apple's built-in Calendar app just does that for me, or I should say, does that really well. I can define colour tags for different calendars and the first-class integration with Apple's softwares on iPhone, and iPad makes this an amazing app for me. I know people tend to use other calendar management apps, `Cron` is one of the new ones and getting lots of traction but `Calendar` does everything I want so I'm sticking with it. Don't touch it if it's working!
- Reminders
  Task management is a different situation from calendar where I've tried various other apps before coming back to Apple's built-in `Reminders`. I couldn't imagine this just two years ago in 2021, when I bought `Things 3` and moved away from `Todoist`. `Reminders` has matured a lot since then, it's got projects (or list as they call it), a whole lot of customization and to organize various lists in folders, first-class Siri support, etc. I moved to Reminders full-time from Things in October 2023, and I think I'm sticking with it!

## Note Taking

- Apple Notes
  Just like Reminders, my typed-notes have been roaming around for a while. I started with `Evernote`, then moved to `OneNote` from Microsoft, `Notion` came along and I jumped on that train and used it for years when I got frustrated with its clunkiness as my notes grew in size as well as number. I briefly moved to `Obsidian` but it seemed extremely ugly to me (I prefer form over function!). This continued, and I experimented with various other apps, while briefly stoppin at `Craft` and in the meanwhile, Apple's very-own `Notes` app got very matured and I started uing their `Quick Note` feature which eventually sucked me into using `Notes` full-time and I think there isn't anything that I'm missing from any of the apps I've previously used, Apple Notes FTW!
- Feyn
  It's a great little app to build flash-cards and I've used it couple times to study. It's very well-built and makes me feel in the Apple's ecosystem.
- Freeform
  I used Apple's Notes for ideation and mind-mapping on iPad using Apple Pencil and now I does that using `Freeform`, it doesn't have all the bells and whistels but it's a solid app that I use from time-to-time to try and refine new ideas and other early prototypes.
- Goodnotes
  Goodnotes has been my primary hand-writte notes app eversince I bought an iPad back in 2021. Whenever I'm taking a new course or learning something new on my own, I jot-down stuff in it and have never felt a need to move away to anything else.
